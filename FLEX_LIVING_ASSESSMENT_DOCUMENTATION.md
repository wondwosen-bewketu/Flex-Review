# Flex Living - Developer Assessment Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Flex Living Reviews Dashboard, a full-stack web application built as part of the Flex Living developer assessment. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for property managers to monitor and analyze guest reviews, as well as a public-facing property page to display selected reviews.

## 2. Scope of Work Implementation

### 2.1 Hostaway Integration (Mocked)

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The application integrates with the Hostaway Reviews API through a robust backend service:

- **API Integration**: The backend uses the Hostaway API to fetch reviews, with authentication using client credentials
- **Data Normalization**: Reviews are normalized to include channel information and date bucketing for better organization
- **Mock Data**: When the API is unavailable, the system gracefully falls back to realistic mock data
- **Data Structure**: Reviews are parsed and normalized with the following properties:
  - Channel information ('hostaway' or 'google')
  - Date bucketing ('recent', 'past-month', 'older')
  - Category ratings and overall ratings
  - Guest and listing information

### 2.2 Manager Dashboard

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The manager dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for property managers:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- **Review Management**: Managers can view all reviews in a tabular format
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Reviews can be filtered by rating, category, channel, date, and search terms
- **Review Selection**: Managers can select specific reviews for public display
- **Performance Metrics**: Dashboard displays key metrics including total reviews, average ratings, and property counts
- **Trend Analysis**: Date bucketing allows managers to spot trends and recurring issues

### 2.3 Review Display Page

**Implementation Status: COMPLETE**

The review display page replicates the Flex Living website property details layout:

- **Property Details**: Displays property information including description, images, and amenities
- **Selected Reviews**: Shows only reviews that have been approved/selected by managers
- **Filtering Options**: Visitors can filter reviews by all, positive, or recent
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays key property performance indicators

### 2.4 Google Reviews (Exploration)

**Implementation Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

Google Reviews integration has been explored and partially implemented:

- **API Integration**: Framework is in place for Google Places API integration
- **Mock Implementation**: Currently uses mock data for demonstration
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions for implementing real Google Reviews integration
- **Findings**: Google Reviews can be integrated via the Places API with proper API keys and billing account

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd flex-reviews-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
   ```env
   HOSTAWAY_ACCOUNT_ID=61148
   HOSTAWAY_API_KEY=f94377ebbbb479490bb3ec364649168dc443dda2e4830facaf5de2e74ccc9152
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY
   PORT=3003
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

5. The backend will be running on http://localhost:3003

### 8.3 Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd flex-reviews-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Update the API base URL in the config file if needed:
   - Open `flex-reviews-frontend/src/config/api.config.ts`
   - The config uses environment variables for production and Vite proxy for development
   - For development, it uses the Vite proxy (empty string)
   - For production, set the `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. The frontend will be running on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)
   - API requests will be automatically proxied to the backend

## 10. Google Reviews Integration

### 10.1 Implementation Status

The Google Reviews integration is currently mocked but ready for production implementation:

- Framework is in place for real API integration

4. Replace the mock implementation in `ReviewsService.fetchGoogleReviews()` with the real API call:

```typescript
const response = await axios.get(`${this.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_BASE}/details/json`, {
  params: {
    place_id: placeId,
    fields: 'reviews',
    key: this.GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY
